# Deep-Learning-Specialization-Coursera
In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry.

I would like to create this repository is purely for academic use (in the case for my future use). I'm really glad if you can use it as a reference and happy to discuss with us about issues related to the course even further deep learning techniques. Please only use it as a reference. The quiz and assignments are relatively easy to answer, hope you can have fun with the courses. #deeplearning #machinelearning #computervision #python #neuralnetworks #datascience #roboticswithpython #keras
